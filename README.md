# image_anywhere

Image Anywhere is a Google Chrome Extension that will target every image on the current web page you are viewing, and offer you the option to save the image directly to your harddrive or Google Drive.

At the bottom right hand corner of each image two buttons will appear, on click:
  - The green button will automatically download the image to your CPU harddrive
  - The google drive button will automatically download the image to your google drive.
